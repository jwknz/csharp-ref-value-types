# Reference and Value Types

Just a quick reference guide to show the difference between value and reference types.

* **Classes** = reference types
* **Structs** = value types

Reference Types change the original value when the variable is placed in a new variable

Value Types keeps the original value value when the variable is placed in a new variable
